# SpainCities Project
Visualization of regions, provinces and cities of Spain.

- 08/04/2025 Change in the look & feel of the application, so that now the information of regions, provinces and cities is displayed on the same page.

## Objective:

Practice .NET (C#) / SQL and Angular (Typescript) / Design Patterns / Onion Architecture.
To explain, roughly to people outside of programming, what is BackEnd, what is FrontEnd and what is BBDD.
and at the same time put together a project that serves to explain where each region of Spain is and what cities it houses.
