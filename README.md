# SpainCities Project
Visualization of regions, provinces and cities of Spain.

## Changelog
- **08/04/2025**: Change in the look & feel of the application, so that now the information of regions, provinces, and cities is displayed on the same page.

## Objective:
Practice **.NET (C#)** / **SQL** and **Angular (Typescript)** / **Design Patterns** / **Onion Architecture**.
To explain, roughly to people outside of programming, what is **BackEnd**, what is **FrontEnd**, and what is **BBDD** (Database).  
At the same time, put together a project that serves to explain where each region of Spain is and what cities it houses.

## Features

### BACKEND:

  - `@angular/animations: 18.2.13`
